    "description": "The Neuromorphic-MNIST (N-MNIST) dataset is a spiking version of the original frame-based MNIST dataset. It consists of the same 60 000 training and 10 000 testing samples as the original MNIST dataset, and is captured at the same visual scale as the original MNIST dataset (28x28 pixels). The N-MNIST dataset was captured by mounting the ATIS sensor on a motorized pan-tilt unit and having the sensor move while it views MNIST examples on an LCD monitor."

    "description": "The ASL-DVS dataset is a large dataset for object classification using neuromorphic vision sensors. It contains 24 classes corresponding to 24 letters of the American Sign Language (excluding J and Z). The dataset was recorded with an iniLabs DAVIS240c NVS camera in an office environment, capturing handshapes performed by five subjects to introduce natural variance. Each class has 4,200 samples, amounting to a total of 100,800 samples. Each sample is approximately 100 milliseconds long. The dataset is designed to facilitate the development and testing of object recognition models based on neuromorphic vision sensors, providing a robust and realistic set of data for evaluating algorithm performance in classifying ASL handshapes."

    "description": "The CIFAR10-DVS dataset is a neuromorphic vision dataset created by converting the standard CIFAR-10 dataset's frame-based images into event streams using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). This dataset contains 10,000 event-stream recordings divided across 10 different classes, each derived from corresponding CIFAR-10 images. The conversion process involved using a repeated closed-loop smooth (RCLS) movement of images in front of the DVS to simulate realistic visual scenarios that the camera might encounter. This method generates rich local intensity changes captured by the DVS, which quantizes these changes into 'events' based on intensity thresholds. The CIFAR10-DVS dataset is designed to be moderately challenging to encourage advancements in event-driven algorithm development for tasks like object recognition in neuromorphic vision systems."

    "description": "The DVS-Gesture dataset is a collection of hand gesture events captured using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), designed for gesture recognition tasks. The dataset includes 11 types of hand gestures performed by 29 subjects under three different lighting conditions, generating a total of over 1.4 million labeled events. This dataset is particularly suited for training and testing gesture recognition systems on neuromorphic hardware, such as the IBM TrueNorth neurosynaptic system. The gestures captured include various hand movements and arm rotations that are typical in human-computer interaction contexts. The dataset's high temporal resolution and its event-driven nature make it ideal for developing low-latency, power-efficient gesture recognition models."

It includes about 1.3 million samples across 1,000 categories. The dataset is created using a novel algorithm called Omnidirectional Discrete Gradient (ODG), which converts traditional frame-based images into neuromorphic event streams, simulating the output of dynamic vision sensors (DVS). This approach captures discrete changes in pixel values, which are then timestamped to create event streams. This dataset aims to support advanced research in neuromorphic vision systems, offering a new benchmark for SNNs to process visual information efficiently and effectively."
