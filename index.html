            <h2>MNIST</h2>
            <p>The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.</p>

            <h2>Google Speech Commands v2</h2>
            <p>The Google Speech Commands dataset is a dataset of spoken words designed to help train machine learning models for speech recognition. The dataset consists of over 105,000 WAV audio files of people saying 30 different words. The dataset is split into 65,000 training files and 40,000 testing files. The dataset is designed to be used for training machine learning models to recognize spoken words.
