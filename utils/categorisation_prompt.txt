Here are the categories:

1. Supervised Learning:
	•	Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP):
		•	STDP is a biologically inspired learning rule where the timing of spikes determines the weight updates. It strengthens connections when the presynaptic spike precedes the postsynaptic spike and weakens them otherwise.
		•	Example: Masquelier et al. used competitive STDP for spike pattern learning.
	•	Gradient Descent Methods:
		•	These methods adapt backpropagation for SNNs. Since the spiking activity is non-differentiable, surrogate gradients or approximations are often used.
		•	Example: Lee et al. trained deep spiking neural networks using backpropagation through surrogate gradients.

2. Unsupervised Learning:
	•	Unsupervised STDP:
		•	Similar to supervised STDP but without labeled data. It focuses on feature extraction and learning representations directly from the input data.
		•	Example: Diehl and Cook used unsupervised STDP for digit recognition.
	•	Spike-Timing Unsupervised Neural Networks (STUNNs):
		•	This category includes networks like BLiTNet that leverage local unsupervised learning rules, balancing mechanisms, and spike timing coding.
		•	Example: The paper by Stratton et al. demonstrates a STUNN that achieves high performance on MNIST with unsupervised learning.

3. Reinforcement Learning:
	•	Reward-Modulated STDP:
		•	Combines STDP with reward signals, where synaptic changes are modulated by rewards or punishments, aligning with reinforcement learning principles.
		•	Example: Florian et al. used reward-modulated STDP for motor control tasks.
	•	Policy Gradient Methods:
		•	Uses reinforcement learning algorithms adapted for SNNs, focusing on optimizing a policy to maximize cumulative rewards.
		•	Example: Seung used reinforcement learning with stochastic synaptic transmission.

4. Hybrid Approaches:
	•	Combination of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:
		•	These methods integrate both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to leverage the strengths of each.
		•	Example: Tavanaei et al. combined deep learning in SNNs with both supervised and unsupervised phases for training.
	•	Unsupervised Pre-training followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning:
		•	Networks are first trained in an unsupervised manner to learn useful features and then fine-tuned with supervised learning.
		•	Example: An SNN might use unsupervised STDP for feature learning and supervised backpropagation for classification tasks.

5. Spike-Based Backpropagation Variants:
	•	Event-Driven Backpropagation:
		•	These methods adapt backpropagation to event-driven processing, typical in spiking neurons, by approximating gradients using spike times.
		•	Example: Mostafa proposed a spiking variant of backpropagation for event-driven processing.

6. Reservoir Computing and Liquid State Machines:
	•	Reservoir Computing:
		•	Uses a fixed, randomly connected network of spiking neurons (reservoir) and trains only the readout layer. The reservoir transforms input signals into high-dimensional representations.
		•	Example: Maass et al. introduced liquid state machines for real-time computing without stable states.
