# snnbench

This site is built to host benchmarked results of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) from leading research papers. This initiative is maintained by myseklf, an enthusiast and researcher in the field of computational neuroscience and neuromorphic computing. The goal is to track the leading approaches and the current state of the art in spiking neural networks.

The site can be found at [snnbench.com](https://snnbench.com) or [snnbenchmarks.com](https://snnbenchmarks.com), if you would be interested in contributing please reach out to myself, my contact detail can be found on my personal site [daniellong.co](https://daniellong.co/).
